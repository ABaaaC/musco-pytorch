MUSCO documentation
=========================================
MUSCO is a framework for MUlti-Stage COmpression of neural networks based on iterative low-rank tensor approximations. The approach was proposed in the 2019 ICCVW paper  `Automated Multi-Stage Compression of Neural Networks <https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/LPCV/Gusak_Automated_Multi-Stage_Compression_of_Neural_Networks_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf>`_.
